<div align="center">
I am a software engineer and interested in computer science. I will not stop learning and I believe that a person should be learning until the last moment of his life. I love to try new technologies and in this case I did not define a boundary for myself! Also, I am a graphic designer and a lover of the art world, who works as a freelancer.
